Hi there! Welcome to PySig, this is a quick little script I made thats designed to
help company admins enforce uniform email signatures for employees that use google apps for business. Hope you like!
This script already has a basic template for an email signature built into it that you can customize for whatever you or your company desires
and lets you seamlessly create signatures for new employees or even update their signatures in the event of promotion (or demotion, yikes!)
This my first project in the world of git and development in general so any ideas, tips or general connection is much appreciated, always willing to learn!
